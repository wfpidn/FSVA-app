            "content": "<p>Since 2003, the Government of Indonesia, in collaboration with WFP, has enhanced its understanding of the state of food security in Indonesia&ndash; including at the local level &ndash; through the development of food security and vulnerability atlases (FSVAs). These atlases are valuable tools for enhancing the targeting of programmes and the design of policies that aim to improve food and nutrition security throughout the nation. The 2015 FSVA is the latest product of this joint collaboration.</p>\n\n<p>The FSVA includes 13 indicators based on a review of data availability at the district level and their ability to measure various aspects of food and nutrition security. The FSVA divides these indicators into two sets: <strong>chronic</strong> food and nutrition insecurity and <strong>transitory</strong> food insecurity. Within chronic, indicators measure <strong>food availability, food access, </strong>and<strong> food utilization</strong>. The transitory indicators describe <strong>climatic and environmental factors</strong> that affect food insecurity<strong> </strong>from an availability and access perspective. The nine indicators that relate to chronic food insecurity are combined into a single composite indicator to describe the overall <strong>district food security classification.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The food and nutrition security conceptual framework shown here forms the basis for the analysis in the FSVA. The framework is based on three pillars of food security &ndash; availability, access and utilization &ndash; and integrates important nutrition and vulnerability considerations. A fourth dimension or pillar of food security refers to stability. This is reflected in the FSVA in terms of chronic versus transitory or acute food insecurity.</p>"

Districts in priority groups 1 and 2 are relatively more vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity; those in priority groups 3 and 4 are moderately vulnerable; and those in priority groups 5 and 6 are less vulnerable or food secure. It is important to note that as a result of diversity within districts, not all people in top-priority districts (groups 1 and 2) are food-insecure, while not all of those in low-priority districts (groups 5 and 6) are food-secure.</p>\n\n<p>The methodology for ranking and categorizing districts into priority groups was updated for this 2015 atlas by including cluster analysis and discriminant analysis in addition to the principal component analysis method used in previous atlases. Principal component analysis is used to determine the weight of each individual indicator within the composite index, while cluster and discriminant analyses are used to classify each district into one of six priority groups. The combination of these three methodologies increases the objectivity, robustness and reliability of results.</p>"

This indicator focuses on the production of selected cereal and tuber crops &ndash; rice, maize, cassava and sweet potatoes in 398 rural districts. These crops were selected because they provide almost 50 percent of the daily calorie intake in the average Indonesian diet, and data on their production are reported regularly at the district level. This ratio indicates the degree to which an area is self-sufficient in cereal and tuber production.&nbsp; While the cereal availability indicator measures whether a district produces sufficient quantities of calorie-rich food, it does not provide information on the local availability of nutrient-rich foods because it does not analyse foods from animal sources, pulses, fruits, vegetables and other nutritious foods produced within the district.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Cereal production in the 398 districts was calculated by computing the average production of rice, maize, cassava and sweet potatoes over the three production years of 2011&ndash;2013. Net average production in cereal equivalents was calculated for each crop using standard conversion factors of one-to-one for rice and maize and three-to-one for cassava and sweet potatoes &ndash; 3 kg of cassava or sweet potatoes is equivalent to 1 kg of rice or maize in terms of calorific value (FSA, 2012). The four components were then added together to calculate total production in cereal equivalent. Net cereal availability per capita was calculated at the district level by dividing the district&rsquo;s total production in cereal equivalent by its estimated population for the middle year of the three-year period, i.e. 2012. Data on trade and imports were not considered because they were not available for the district level. Based on the Indonesian consumption profile, the normative recommended per capita cereal consumption is 300 g per day, which was used to compute the per capita normative consumption to production ratio.</p>"

Inability to meet food needs for a temporary period is known as transient food insecurity, which can be triggered by a sudden natural or technological disaster, a slow-onset disaster, price or market shocks, health epidemics or civil conflict, among other causes.</p>\n\n<p>Transient food insecurity is often divided into two subcategories: cyclical food insecurity, when a regular pattern of food insecurity is repeated every year, for example during the lean season in the period just before harvest; and temporary food insecurity, which is the result of a short-term, exogenous shock such as a drought or flood. Civil conflict is also a temporary shock, but its negative impact on food security often continues over an extended period. Transient food insecurity can affect chronically food-insecure households by pushing them into more severe or acute food insecurity as the result of the temporary shock; it can also affect households that are usually food-secure.</p>\n\n<p>This chapter analyses food insecurity from a climatic and environmental perspective. Climatic and environmental factors and people&rsquo;s ability to cope with shocks underscore the ability of a country or region to achieve and maintain food and nutrition security.

Deforestation, rainfall variability and the extent of the area affected by floods and landslides are some of the indicators used to explain transient food insecurity in Indonesia.</p>\n\n<p>To conduct a comprehensive analysis of climatic conditions affecting transient food insecurity, four key factors were examined for the 2014 FSVA: i) a summary of natural disasters experienced at district level, ii) an estimation of rice production loss due to floods or drought, iii) the rate of deforestation and iv) the strength of the El Ni&ntilde;o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) which drives rainfall variability.</p>"
