            "content": "<p>Since 2003, the Government of Indonesia, in collaboration with WFP, has enhanced its understanding of the state of food security in Indonesia&ndash; including at the local level &ndash; through the development of food security and vulnerability atlases (FSVAs). The national FSVA was published in 2005, 2009 and 2015 containing analysis down at district level. To obtain a finer resolution of the food security situation in the province, down to the sub-district, the Food Security Office (FSO) of East Java, working together with WFP, developed the comprehensive geographic profile of food and nutrition security across province through the development of East Java FSVA. The East Java FSVA provides data and information for policy-makers in determining vulnerable areas and formulating recommendations for improving food and nutrition security at the provincial, district, and sub-district level.</p>\n<p>The FSVA includes 12 indicators based on a review of data availability at the sub-district level and their ability to measure various aspects of food and nutrition security. The FSVA divides these indicators into two sets: <strong>chronic</strong> food and nutrition insecurity and <strong>transitory</strong> food insecurity. Within chronic, indicators measure <strong>food availability, food access, </strong>and<strong> food utilization</strong>. The transitory indicators describe <strong>climatic and environmental factors</strong> that affect food insecurity<strong> </strong>from an availability and access perspective. The nine indicators that relate to chronic food insecurity are combined into a single composite indicator to describe the overall <strong>sub-district food security classification.</strong></p>\n<p>Some of the chronic food and nutrition insecurity indicators used in the East Java FSVA are derived using a method called Small Area Estimation (SAE). SAE is a process by which an esimate of an indicator can be generated at a lower spatial resolution (i.e. sub-district) by building a statistical model using survey data and applying the model to a common set of variables collected at a lower level, specifically using census data. The survey and census data used in this SAE model are the 2013 National Socio-Economic Survey (SUSENAS), PODES 2014 and the 2010 census.</p>\n<p>The food and nutrition security conceptual framework shown here forms the basis for the analysis in the FSVA. The framework is based on three pillars of food security &ndash; availability, access and utilization. Stabiulity is considered a fourth dimension or pillar of food security and is reflected in the FSVA in terms of chronic versus transitory (or acute) food insecurity.</p>"
